I worked on the following tasks:
1. Studied how to display and generate a random picture with Unsplash API.

3. Review the project organization of the project files. Solve some frequent errors via mocking a user to visit our platform. 
4. Watched again the "Let's build a reminder app" part1,2,3 to concrete my knowledge of the project.d
